# JavaScript capstone project


This is an API-based App. A Microverse JavaScript Capstone project. It is about building a web application based on an external `API`. We used the following two `APIs`:
[x] [TVmaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) - For data about TV series and movies
[x] [Involvement API](https://www.notion.so/microverse/Involvement-API-869e60b5ad104603aa6db59e08150270) - To record the different user interactions (likes, comments and reservations)





## Built With

[x] Major languages - `HTML`, `CSS`, `SASS` and `JavaScript`
[x] Frameworks - `Webpack`, `Bootstrap`, `Jest`, `JSON` and `Nodejs`
[x] Technologies used - `ES6 Modules`, `Callbacks/Promises`, `Gitflow` and `APIs`
